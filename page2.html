<h2 align="center" >Diffrent versions of HTML</h2>
<hr>
<p>Over the years there have been reiterations of HTML, the newer the more in depth you could go. The most recent and mostly used HTML is HTML5.</p>
<hr>
 <P>HTML1.0</p>
<P>HTML 1.0 was the first release of HTML. There really wasn’t much you could do
    with it besides getting some simple text onto the web.</p>
<hr>
<P>HTML 2.0</p>
<P>HTML 2.0 included everything from the original 1.0 specifications but added a few new features to the mix.
HTML 2.0 was the standard for website design until January 1997 and defined many core HTML features for the first time.
<hr>
<p>HTML 3.0</p>
<P>More and more people were starting to use HTML and a company called 
Netscape was the clear leader in the browser market at the time, with a browser called Netscape Navigator. They introduced new proprietary tags and attributes into their 
Netscape Navigator browser. These new abilities were called Netscape extension tags. This caused big problems as other browsers tried to replicate the effects of these tags so as not to be left behind but could not get their browsers to display things the same way.
A HTML working group, led by a man named Dave Raggett introduced a new HTML draft, HTML 3.0. It included many new and improved abilities for HTML, and promised far more powerful opportunities for webmasters to design their pages.</p>
<hr>
<p>HTML 3.2</p>
<p>The browser-specific tags kept coming, and it became increasingly apparent that a standard needed to be found. To this end, the » World Wide Web Consortium (abbreviated to the W3C) was founded in 1994 to standardise the 
language and keep it evolving in the right direction. Their first work was code-named WILBUR, and later became known as » HTML 3.2. This was a toned-down change to the existing standards, leaving many of the big steps forward for later versions.</p>
<hr>
<p>HTML 4.01</p>
<p>HTML 4.0 was recommended by the W3C in December ’97 and became the official standard in April 1998. Browser support was undertaken surprisingly earnestly by Microsoft in their Internet Explorer browser, and the market-leading IE5 (and current successor IE6) have excellent support for almost all of the new tags and attributes. 
In comparison, Netscape’s terribly flawed Navigator 4.7 was inept when it came to HTML 4.0 and even basic CSS. Modern browsers however, are a vast improvement. Once HTML 4.0 had been out for a little while, the documentation was revised and corrected in a few minor ways and was entitled HTML 4.01; the final version of the specification.</p>
<hr>
<p>XHTML 1</p>
<p>Close to the beginning of the 21st century the W3C issued their specifications of XHTML 1.0 as a recommendation. Since January 26, 2000 it stands as the joint-standard with HTML 4.01. XHTML marks a departure from the way new specs have worked it is an 
entirely new branch of HTML, incorporating the rigours of XML, so that code must be properly written if it is to work once it reaches the reader’s browser. There weren’t many new or deprecated tags and attributes in XHTML, but some things changed with a view of increased accessibility and functionality.</p>
<hr>
<p>XHTML5</p>
<p>It was around this time that a bunch of pragmatic web technology fans, browser programmers and specification writers started building something of their own, outside of the usual W3C procedures. They called themselves the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), 
and developed a new spec. After some soul-searching, the W3C decided that HTML was still the future of the web. XHTML 2 was discontinued and HTML5 became the new specification that everyone’s effort should be poured into. HTML5 is designed for the web, both now and in the future. </p>
